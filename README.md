# Rental Management System

## Description

The **Rental Management System** is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that allows property managers and landlords to efficiently manage their rental properties. The system enables users to handle various tasks such as managing properties, tenants, and payments, as well as generating reports and updating property statuses. This system is built using Python and PostgreSQL.

## Features

1. **Property Management**: Add, view, update, and delete properties.
2. **Tenant Management**: Add tenants and view tenant information, including linked property addresses.
3. **Payment Tracking**: Add rental payments and view payments, including tenant names and property addresses.
4. **Update Property Status**: Change the status of properties (e.g., available, rented, under maintenance).
5. **Delete Properties**: Delete properties and manage dependencies (tenants and payments).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing property, tenant, and payment information.
- **Psycopg2**: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for user interaction.
